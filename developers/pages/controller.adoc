= Controllers for Page Types

Like single pages, page types can also employ controllers.
The `view()` method for a page type's controller will automatically be run any time a page of that type is browsed to in the site.
This controller can send data from that page type into the view.

== Check the Page Type

First, make sure you know your desired page type's handle.
Let's say we want to add a controller to the built-in "Blog Entry" page type, which has a handle of blog_entry.

== Create the controller file

Create a controller file at `application/controllers/page_types/blog_entry.php`

== Create the controller class within the file

The controller class should have the StudlyCapsed version of your page type handle, within the `\Concrete\Controller\PageType` namespace.

[source,php]
----
<?php

namespace Application\Controller\PageType;

use Concrete\Core\Page\Controller\PageTypeController;

class BlogEntry extends PageTypeController
{
    public function view()
    {
    }
}
----

=== Controller Note

In this example, the page type controller extends the PageTypeController class within the `\Concrete\Core\Page\Controller` namespace, rather than the PageController.
This is not strictly necessary, as currently the `PageTypeController` class is an empty class that just extends `PageController` - but in the future there might be important methods that we place within `PageTypeController`, so it's smart to extend that class just the same.

== That's It

That's all you have to do.
Any `view()` method within the page type controller will automatically be fired, and any data it sets will be available in the page's template.
